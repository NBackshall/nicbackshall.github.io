I'm a Senior Robotics Research Engineer currently focused on bringing advanced robotics into everyday homes. My work centers on developing efficient algorithms for robot manipulation, bridging cutting-edge academic concepts with practical applications. I aim to create intelligent, user-friendly robots that can seamlessly integrate into our daily lives. This current endeavor builds on over 7 years of diverse engineering experience, including previous work in app development where I created innovative iOS and Android applications for Dyson. By merging my varied background in software, mechanical, and electrical engineering with current robotics research, I bring a unique perspective to tackling the challenges of robot learning.
